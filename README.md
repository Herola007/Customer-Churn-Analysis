I recently completed an analysis of Sway Bank Inc., an European bank with operations across Germany, Spain, and France. Sway Bank serves 10,000 customers across these countries, each exhibiting unique attributes and behaviors. France accounts for the largest share with 5,014 customers, followed by Germany with 2,509 customers, and Spain with 2,477 customers.

The bank also has a 20.37% churn rate. The data shows a higher percentage of male customers (54.57%) compared to female customers (45.43%). Male customers have a slightly longer average tenure of 5.05 years and a total account balance of €421.14 million, while female customers have an average tenure of 4.97 years and a total account balance of €343.72 million.

A column chart was created to show the distribution of customers by age bracket.

Senior customers, aged 50 and above, rank third with 1,395 customers, a total account balance of €112.2M, and the highest churn rate at 45.45%.

A bar chart was created to show the total customers by creditworthiness. The chart shows that the majority of the bank's customers fall into the "fair" creditworthiness category, with a credit score between 580-669. This group includes 3,331 customers, a churn rate of 20.5%, and an average tenure of 5.07 years. Customers with "good" creditworthiness with credit score between 670-739, total 2,428, with a churn rate of 18.62% and an average tenure of 4.95 years. Lastly, customers with "excellent" creditworthiness whose credit score fell between 800-850 represent the smallest group, with 655 customers, a churn rate of 19.54%, and an average tenure of 4.97 years.

A pie chart was created to display the total number of customers with credit cards. The chart shows that 5,151 customers held credit cards, with a total account balance of €390.8M and a churn rate of 14.27%. On the other hand, 4,849 customers did not have credit cards, with an account balance of €374M and a significantly higher churn rate of 26.85%.

The chart reveals that there are 5,151 active customers, while 4,849 customers are classified as inactive, with a churn rate of 26.85%.

Now, let’s dive into the main focus of this analysis. I found that 2,037 customers have churned from Sway Bank. These churned customers had an average tenure of 4.93 years, an average credit score of 645, and a total account balance of €185.59 million.
#### Key Insights
I created a bar chart displaying the total number of churned customers by country. The chart reveals that Germany had the highest number of churned customers, with 814 customers and a total account balance of €98M, alongside an average tenure of 5 years. France followed closely with 810 churned customers, a total account balance of €57.7M, and the same average tenure of 5 years. In contrast, Spain had the lowest number of churned customers, with 413, a total account balance of €30M, and an average tenure of 4.66 years. The distribution of churned customers was visualized using a pie chart. This chart highlighted that 55.92% of the bank’s churned customers were female, while 44.08% were male.

I further created a column chart to illustrate the distribution of churned customers by age bracket. The chart shows that middle-aged customers, within the age range of 40-49, had the highest number of churned customers, totaling 806. Senior customers, aged 50 and above, followed with 634 churned customers. Lastly, adult customers, aged 18-39, had the lowest churn rate, with 597 churned customers. This breakdown provides insight into the age demographics most affected by churn.

The analysis also revealed that customers with credit cards had a lower churn rate (36.08%) compared to those without credit cards, who had a significantly higher churn rate of 68.92%. Moreover, the dashboard showed that customers with fair and poor credit scores were more likely to leave the bank, while those with excellent credit scores were less likely to churn. 

The number of product shows the number of bank product the customer uses, the products includes credit card, savings account and the likes. The analysis shows that the more product a customer uses the less likely they are to churn but the less products a customer uses the more they are likely to churn. 

### Sway Bank Inc. Customer Status Dashboard

Sway Bank Inc. also requested a quick summary of active and non-active customers. Using the dashboard I created, it was revealed that the bank has 5,151 active customers and 4,849 non-active customers. The average tenure of non-active customers was 5.10 years, with a total account balance of €374M. In comparison, active customers hold a slightly higher total account balance of €390.8M. 
#### Key Insights
A clustered bar chart was created to visualize customer status by country. The chart shows that France had the highest number of both active and non-active customers, with 2,591 active customers and 2,423 non-active customers. Spain followed with 1,312 active customers and 1,165 non-active customers, the lowest figures among the three countries. Germany had 1,248 active customers, the least among the countries, and 1,261 non-active customers. This chart provides a clear breakdown of customer activity across Sway Bank's operating countries. 

The analysis also included a column chart revealing customer status by gender. The chart shows that the bank had 2,867 active male customers and 2,590 non-active male customers. For female customers, there were 2,284 active customers and 2,259 non-active customers.  


### Recommendation
Since customers with credit cards have a significantly lower churn rate (36.08%) compared to those without (68.92%), Sway Bank should actively encourage customers to obtain credit cards. Offering tailored credit card benefits or incentives could further enhance customer engagement and retention. The analysis also shows that customers with fair or poor credit scores are more likely to churn. Sway Bank should introduce personalized credit improvement programs, offering financial literacy, credit-building products, and more favorable terms for customers at risk. This would not only help reduce churn but also strengthen customer loyalty.
